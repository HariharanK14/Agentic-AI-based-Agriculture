# Agentic-AI-based-Agriculture
This project presents an integrated, agentic AI-powered decision-support system for agriculture, focusing on crop production prediction and suitability mapping. The system is built with Streamlit and combines Machine Learning (Random Forest), Deep Learning (DNN), and Large Language Models (LLMs) to deliver transparent, actionable, and user-friendly insights for farmers, agricultural advisors, and policymakers in Tamil Nadu, India.

The solution addresses the limitations of traditional black-box AI systems by incorporating explainable outputs and interactive geospatial visualizations. The crop suitability module uses a Deep Neural Network to recommend optimal crops for specific districts based on environmental and geographic data, visualized through an interactive Folium map. The crop production module employs a Random Forest Regressor to predict yield, analyze feature importance, and compare historical versus predicted production values.

A key feature is the agentic AI workflow, powered by the phi-agent framework, which automates the machine learning pipeline and generates natural language explanations using Google Gemini and Groq Llama 3.1. The system includes robust error handling, role-based access, and a user-friendly interface to ensure accessibility in resource-limited settings.

By uniting predictive modeling, explainable AI, and interactive visualization, this platform enables informed, transparent, and adaptive agricultural decision-making, supporting sustainable practices, climate resilience, and improved food security.
